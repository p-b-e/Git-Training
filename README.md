# Git-Training
📚 Git Learning & Research Repository

This repository contains all the material I’ve produced while learning and practicing Git.

It is a personal knowledge base that mixes:

🧪 Hands-on experiments

📖 Research notes

🛠️ Command testing

🔁 Workflow practice

⚙️ Configuration examples

The goal is to understand Git deeply by combining theory with real usage.
